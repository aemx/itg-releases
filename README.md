# **CERiNG's ITG Releases Repository**
This repository serves as a collection of tech, stamina, and other non-modded ITG files by CERiNG. This includes packs and standalone files.

*NOTE: This repository does not include standalone files created for community-directed collaboration or contest packs.*

## **Installation**
All files in this repository are optimized to work best with modern versions of StepMania. I personally recommend [**ITGmania**](https://github.com/itgmania/itgmania), but you can use other versions of StepMania at your discretion.

### **For packs**
Download the selected pack, and unzip the contents directly into the `Songs` folder. You're all set!

### **For standalone files**
Download the selected file, and unzip the contents wherever you'd like. Then, unzip the contents within a subdirectory in the `Songs` folder (ex. `Songs\MyPackName`).
